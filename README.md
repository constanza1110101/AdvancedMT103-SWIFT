## Overview

This advanced MT103 parser is designed for cybersecurity professionals who need to analyze, validate, and secure SWIFT payment messages. It provides comprehensive security features including cryptographic protection, integrity verification, and compliance with the latest SWIFT standards as the financial industry migrates to ISO 20022.

## Key Security Features

- **Advanced Threat Detection**: Identifies suspicious transactions, high-risk jurisdictions, and unusual patterns
- **Cryptographic Protection**: Military-grade encryption with AES-256 and password-based key derivation
- **Data Integrity Verification**: SHA-256 hash signatures to detect message tampering
- **Compliance Checking**: Validation against current SWIFT standards with detailed error reporting
- **Secure Database Integration**: Encrypted storage with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity logging for forensic analysis
- **Sanctions Screening**: Detection of transactions involving sanctioned entities or countries

## Technical Features

- **High-Performance Parsing**: Optimized regex pattern matching for fast processing of MT103 fields
- **Comprehensive Field Validation**: Validates against SWIFT standards with 20+ validation rules
- **Multi-threaded Processing**: Parallel processing for high-volume message analysis
- **Export Flexibility**: Secure JSON, CSV, and XML export with detailed field information
- **Interactive CLI**: Rich console interface with formatted tables and progress tracking
- **Database Search**: Advanced query capabilities for transaction intelligence

## Installation

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-mt103-parser.git
cd advanced-mt103-parser

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Quick Start

from mt103_parser import MT103Parser

# Parse a message
message = "{1:F01BANKBEBB}{2:I103...}..."
parser = MT103Parser(message)

# Analyze security aspects
security_issues = parser.analyze_security()

# Validate against SWIFT standards
if parser.validation_errors:
    print(f"Found {len(parser.validation_errors)} compliance issues")

# Store securely with encryption
parser.encrypt_message(password="your-secure-password")
parser.save_to_database()

## Security Analysis Features

# Check for suspicious patterns
parser.analyze_security()

# Verify message integrity
original_hash = parser.hash_signature
# ... later ...
if parser.hash_signature != original_hash:
    print("WARNING: Message has been tampered with!")

# Encrypt sensitive data
encrypted = parser.encrypt_message(password="strong-password")

## Batch Processing for Security Analysis

# Process multiple messages for security screening
results = MT103Parser.batch_process("input/messages.txt", "output")

# Find suspicious transactions
for result in results:
    if not result['valid']:
        print(f"Security alert: Invalid message {result['id']}")
        parser = MT103Parser.load_from_database(result['hash'])
        parser.analyze_security()

## ISO 20022 Migration Support

The parser includes features to support the transition to ISO 20022, which becomes mandatory for cross-border payments in November 2025:

- Field validation aligned with both MT103 and ISO 20022 pacs.008 requirements
- Data extraction for enhanced party information required by ISO 20022
- Support for extended character sets and structured addressing
- Compatibility with SWIFT Transaction Manager requirements

## Security Best Practices

- All sensitive data is encrypted using industry-standard algorithms
- Password-based key derivation uses PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- No plaintext credentials are stored in configuration files
- Database connections use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Comprehensive input validation to prevent code injection attacks
- Secure error handling to prevent information disclosure

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- cryptography>=40.0.0
- rich>=13.3.0
- sqlite3 (included in Python standard library)

## Compliance

This tool helps financial institutions meet requirements for:

- SWIFT Customer Security Programme (CSP)
- Anti-Money Laundering (AML) transaction monitoring
- Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) screening
- Sanctions compliance
